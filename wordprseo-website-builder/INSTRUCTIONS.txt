Upload one or more PDF, DOCX, PPTX, or TXT files (you can also upload a ZIP archive containing these formats). The tool extracts their text and sends it to Google Gemini to generate a page with Hero, About Us, Services, and Contact sections. Each section includes a title and subtitle.

Files are processed in memory and removed immediately, so uploads are not stored on the server. Replace the API key in index.php with your own if needed.
